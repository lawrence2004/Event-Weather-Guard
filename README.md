# 🌦️ Event Weather Guard

A Spring Boot backend service that analyzes hourly weather forecasts and determines whether an outdoor event is **Safe**, **Risky**, or **Unsafe** based on deterministic, explainable rules.

This project was built as a **backend intern take‑home assignment** focusing on API design, external integration, validation, and clean business logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

* REST API to analyze weather risk for outdoor events based on a given time window
* Integration with Open-Meteo public weather API using hourly forecasts
* Deterministic Safe / Risky / Unsafe classification using clearly defined rules
* Numeric severity score (0–100) to quantify overall weather risk
* Human-readable explanations with time-range aggregation (rain, wind, storms)
* Robust input validation (past dates, invalid ranges, forecast limits)
* Centralized global exception handling with structured error responses
* Clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Client → Rule Engine)
* Swagger / OpenAPI documentation for easy API exploration
* Stateless design with no database or authentication, as per assignment scope

## ⚖️ Weather Classification Rules

The system applies **deterministic, explainable rules** based on hourly weather data.

### ❌ Unsafe

* Rain probability **> 80%** during any event hour, OR
* Wind speed **> 40 km/h** during any event hour

### ⚠️ Risky

* Rain probability **> 60%** during any event hour

### ✅ Safe

* None of the above conditions are met

### 🎯 Severity Score (0–100)

In addition to classification, a numeric severity score is computed:

* Rain severity = rain probability (0–100)
* Wind severity = normalized to 0–100 (50 km/h treated as extreme)
* Hourly severity = `0.6 × rain + 0.4 × wind`
* Event severity = **maximum hourly severity** (worst‑case driven)

Severity score is **additive** and does not override classification rules.

---

The service classifies events using **deterministic rules**:

### ❌ Unsafe

* Thunderstorm forecast detected
* Rain probability ≥ **80%**
* Wind speed ≥ **40 km/h**

### ⚠️ Risky

* Rain probability between **60%** and **79%**
* Wind speed between **25 km/h** and **39 km/h**

### ✅ Safe

* No Unsafe or Risky conditions are detected during the event window

Each response includes **human‑readable reasons** explaining which rule(s) were triggered.

---

## 🧠 Design Overview

* **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and validation
* **Service Layer**: Orchestrates flow and validates business rules
* **WeatherApiClient**: Isolates external API integration (Open‑Meteo)
* **Rule Engine**: Applies deterministic weather classification logic
* **DTOs**: Clean request/response models with validation
* **Global Exception Handler**: Centralized error handling

This separation keeps the system **clean, testable, and easy to explain**.

## ⚠️ Validation & Error Handling

* Request fields are validated using Jakarta Bean Validation
* Logical validation ensures startTime is in the future
* Logical validation ensures endTime is after startTime
* Event time window is validated to be within the supported forecast range (next 7 days)
* Invalid or unsupported requests return structured JSON error responses
* All errors are handled centrally using a global exception handler

Example 1 error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Event start time must be in the future",
  "status": 400
}
```

Example 2 error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Event start time cannot be greater than end time",
  "status": 400
}
```

Example 3 error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Weather forecast not available for the given time window",
  "status": 404
}
```

## 🔍 Key Assumptions & Trade‑offs

* Weather forecasts are **hourly**, and all evaluations align strictly to hourly boundaries
* Classification logic is **rule‑based and deterministic** for transparency and explainability
* The **severity score** is additive and does not override classification rules
* Alternate time recommendations are generated **only for RISKY or UNSAFE events**
* Recommended windows preserve the **original event duration** but shift the time window to reduce weather risk
* External weather API failures result in a fast‑fail error response
* No persistence layer or authentication is included (out of scope)
* Controller tests are intentionally omitted; unit tests focus on **service‑layer business logic**
